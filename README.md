# Frontend Mentor - Social proof section

This is a solution to the [Social proof section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-proof-section-6e0qTv_bA).


## Overview 👋

Thanks for checking out this **front-end coding challenge💓**

## The challenge

My challenge is to build out this social proof section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.


Users should be able to:
- View the **optimal layout** for the section depending on their device's screen size
- See, **hover effect** in ratings and testimonials component. Just see it's looking amazing❤️
- Used **slow entrance animation** when page loaded🔥 and added **underline effect** also in testimonials heading 2.
